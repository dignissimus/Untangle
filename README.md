# Untangle
Untangle is a Lean4 widget that displays string diagrams for morphisms inside categories and allows you to rewrite expressions by clicking on natural transformations and morphisms in the string diagram.

Currently, Untangle only supports two rewrite rules for Monads but in the future I'd like to add the rest of the Monad laws then add rules for Hopf algebras.
# Example usage
Open the `Example.lean` file and follow the instructions
